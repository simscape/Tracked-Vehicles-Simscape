%
% This example models a single track from an excavator. Contact between the
% track and the ground is modeled using a point cloud on the track shoes.
% The track can be tested on uneven terrain, a slope, or a flat road with
% bumps. The sprocket is driven with a flexible driveshaft. The track shoes
% are modeled using CAD geometry.

%% Model
%
% In this example, one track is modeled and half of the excavator mass is
% centered on the track.  This enables faster adjustments of the track
% model which can then be mirrored to the second track.

%% Track Subsystem
%
% The track is composed of the undercarriage and the track segments
% connected into a loop.  The undercarriage contains the rollers, sprocket,
% and idler which are rigidly attached to the frame.  These are connected
% to the track chain through three sets of contact forces. 
% 
% 1. The chain wraps around the idler
%
% <<sm_excv_contact_idlerToChain_Overview.png>>
%
% 2. The rollers roll along the chains
%
% <<sm_excv_contact_rollerUToChain_Overview.png>>
%
% 3. The chain pins mesh with the sprocket teeth
%
% <<sm_excv_contact_sprocketToChain_Overview.png>>
%
% The Planar Track joint positions one of the chain pins at a gap between
% the sprocket teeth which is positioned facing the rear of the track.
% Joint targets applied to the track segments helps it to mesh with other
% teeth on the sprocket and loosely wrap around the rollers and idler. The
% block Transform Half Seg Angle orients the interface frame so that the
% two chain segments attached to that pin will wrap around the sprocket.

%% Rollers Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the rollers, idler, and sprocket.  They each can
% rotate around shafts attached to the lower frame. A spring is included in
% the Prismatic Tensioner joint that pushes the idler against the chain to
% maintain tension. 
%
% The sprocket joint interfaces to 1D mechanical rotational port.  This
% represents a mechanical shaft connection to the sprocket. It can be
% attached to Simscape models of gears, hydrostatic transmissions, and
% electric motors.
%
% The bus of connections at port R contains the connections to the geometry
% that is used to model contact between the rollers, idler, and sprocket to
% the chain.

%% Track Subsystem
%
% A set of track segments are joined using Revolute Joints to model the
% track. The joints are contained in each segment. Joint targets are
% assigned in the mask to ensure the track meshes with the sprocket and
% wraps loosely around the rollers and idler.

%% Track Segment Subsystem
%
% Each track segment is composed of a chain link and a shoe. To streamline
% the contact force calculation, simpler geometry is connected to the
% Spatial Contact Force block.  
%
% # A spherical solid is used to model the pin contacting the sprocket.
% # A brick solid is used to model the chain contacting the rollers and idler.
% # A point cloud is used to model the shoe contacting the ground.
%
% The point cloud for the shoe-ground contact is parameterized, so the
% point locations and density can be varied. For example, points can be
% placed on the shoe plate, or on the plate and grousers simply by varying
% the matrix of point locations.
%
% Points on shoe plate only
%
% <<sm_excv_contact_trackSeg_PtcldPlate_Overview.png>>

%% Track Shoe Subsystem
%
% In this model, the track shoe is modeled using CAD geometry.  A File
% Solid block refers to the CAD geometry.  Rigid Transform blocks are used
% to ensure the CAD geometry is placed at the right location, compensating
% for any difference in orientation or position between the CAD reference
% frame and the frame used to connect to the chain segment.
