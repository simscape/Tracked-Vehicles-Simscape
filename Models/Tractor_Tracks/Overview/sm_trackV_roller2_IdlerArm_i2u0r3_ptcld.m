%
% This example models a tracked vehicle with a rubber belts in an abstract
% manner. Contact between the track and the ground is modeled using a point
% cloud on the rollers and idlers. The point cloud radius
% includes the depth of the belt. This method permits significantly faster
% simulation for it is far simpler than modeling each segment of the track
% and all the contact forces with the undercarriage and ground.  Contact
% forces are modeled using the <https://www.mathworks.com/help/sm/ref/spatialcontactforce.html Spatial Contact Force block>.
% 
% The track can be tested on uneven terrain and a slope. The sprocket is
% driven with a flexible driveshaft.

%% Model
%
% In this example, both tracks are modeled along with the chassis.

%% Track Subsystem
%
% The track is composed of the undercarriage and a visual element to
% represent the track segments which includes parameters for the assumed
% mass, inertia, and CG of the belt segments.  The undercarriage contains
% the rollers, sprocket, and two idlers. Everything is rigidly attached to
% the frame except one idler is attached to an arm which can pivot
% slightly. Contact geometry (point clouds) in the undercarriage subsystem
% connect via a Simscape bus to
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/sm/ref/spatialcontactforce.html Spatial
% Contact Force block> to model ground contact.

%% Rollers Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the rollers, idler, and sprocket.  They each can
% rotate around shafts attached to the lower frame. One idler is
% attached to an arm which can pivot slightly.
%
% The sprocket joint interfaces to 1D mechanical rotational port.  This
% represents a mechanical shaft connection to the sprocket. It can be
% attached to Simscape models of gears, hydrostatic transmissions, and
% electric motors.
%
% The bus of connections at port R contains the connections to the geometry
% that is used to model contact with the ground.  The rollers and idlers
% have point clouds whose radius includes the depth of the track.

%% Lower Roller Subsystem
%
% The lower rollers, sprocket, and idler contain a solid to represent the
% inertial properties. The rollers and idler include a point cloud to model
% contact with the ground, and a visual element to animate the part
% spinning in the model.

%% Track Subsystem
%
% The track is modeled as a solid. It provides a visual indication of where
% the track segements would be.  It also includes mass and inertia
% properties which can be parameterized to match the full set of track
% segments.

% In this test, the frame with the rollers and idler is fixed and cannot
% rotate respect to the chassis.
