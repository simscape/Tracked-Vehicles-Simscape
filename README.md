# **Tracked Vehicle Model with Simscape&trade;**
Copyright 2024 The MathWorks, Inc.

This repository contains models and code to help engineers model and simulate 
tracked vehicles with chain or belt tracks. A set of examples shows how to 
assemble segments into a track that will mesh with the sprocket, rollers, and 
idlers in the vehicle undercarriage. Models of vehicles traveling on multiple wheels 
are also provided.

* **Fully parameterized models** of tracked and multi-axle vehicles
* **Detailed and abstract variants** for testing different systems
* **Modular library elements** enable assembly of parameterized tracks. 
* **Customizable contact force definition** enable tracked vehicle models tailored to simulation task.
* **MATLAB enables automation** of modeling, simulation, and post-processing tasks.
* **Measure mechanical loads** on rollers and other components.

## **Tracked Vehicle at Varying Fidelity Levels**
Use the model that best suits your needs.  This repository contains abstract, 
fast running models and detailed models that model each segment individually.
